# conf
Collection of dotfiles and notes.  
Nothing of note, really.

- The content of [.bashrc](./.bashrc) should be appended at the end of the default file, it is not a replacement.
- [unix-list](./unix-list.txt) is a very small list of utilities for Linux. I didn't write every CLI I could think of, just those useful but rarely used and hence at risk of being forgotten.
- [win-list](./win-list.txt) is a list of useful programmes for Windows, and addons for Notepad++ and Firefox (very lightweight, for my work computer).
- [intellij_inspections.xml](./intellij_inspections.xml) is a slightly customised inspection profile for IntelliJ IDEA.
